Genetic variants
================

Variation statistics
--------------------

The statistics page shows an overview of all non-olfactory receptors with their absolute and relative 
numbers of reported genetic missense variants. The average density (absolute count divided by length of receptor) is 
presented for each receptor family, ligandtype and class.

Receptor variant browser
------------------------

The selection page allows users to find a receptor by searching or browsing. 
The browser displays all missense and loss of function mutations for the selected receptor. Additional information
for each variant is presented such as position, amino acid change, allele couns/frequencies, number of homozygotes, predicted functional
impact by SIFT and PolyPhen as well as functional annotation of the specific position (PTM site, ligand-binding site, micro-switch, G protein interaction ..)

All variants are hihglighted on helix plot and snake-plot diagrams with predicted deleterious variants (by either SIFT or PolyPhen) highlighted in red or green, respectively/
